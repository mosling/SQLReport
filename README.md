SQLReport
=========

A simple template based report generator using a SQL database as data source and 
normal SQL select statements as datasource.

To compile this project you need the current Qt libraries and the Qt-Creator.
You found this at [QT-project|www.qt-project.org].

The documentation is available at [Gitbub-Wiki|https://github.com/mosling/SQLReport/wiki]

There is a sqlite database chinook ([Chinook|https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/]) which is used for the example templates. You can download your own copy or use the stored database from the binaries directory.
